# Global Robustness Verification Networks

Here we provide the code of SDN in "net_model.py",the back-propagation algorithm in "multpro_back_pro.py", and the verification algorithm in "GeometricDescriptionSample.py".


Take the case study in Section 5.3 as an example, we provide some intermediate results as well.
Such as the net model "model / net.pkl" and the rule-based back-propagation result "rule_TREE".


All the  commands  for the result in Section 5.3 are in "GeometricDescriptionSample.py" where "g_info" is the architecture of SDN, "cons" is the input classification rule, and "configs" is the bound of inputs.


What's moreï¼Œ "GeometricDescriptionSample.py" returns all the connected components and the classifications which are sorted by their volume and "r" respectively.


If you want to test this algorithm, please run "GeometricDescriptionSample.py".
